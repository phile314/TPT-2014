####Exercise 2a1 (big step semantics)
3.0/3.0
Implementation mostly matches the provided solutions.

####Exercise 2a2 (adding pairs)
3.0/3.0
I had interpreted the exercise to be to add tuples. While this gives way more complicated proofs with uglier code (more implicit arguments etc), as far as I can see there are no errors in the code, and all functionality is as desired.

####Exercise 2b
3.0/3.0
Implementation mostly matches the provided solutions.
